## What's the name, again?
The name is **Pushkin A.S.** This stands for *Pushkin Automation Services*, *Pushkin Automated Configurations* or something else like this. Not to be confused with [Alexander Sergeyevich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin), one of the most famous russian poets.

## And what exactly is it?
This is [SDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking) tool. Which is modular and relatively simple yet effective. Simplicity comes from the basic idea: to imitate actions of a human engineer performing commands on a set of devices.

## Installation (demo)

    git clone https://github.com/ilique/webpushkin.git

***
P.S. Why 'Pushkin'? Well, first of all it's our's all, so to speak. And second, services are stored as lines of text - just as lyrics. You can even rythm you service instructions, if you want. 

See [documentation](https://github.com/ilique/webpushkin/wiki) for details.
